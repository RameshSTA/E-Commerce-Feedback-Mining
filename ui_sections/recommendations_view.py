        <li><strong>Sentiment Hotspots:</strong> While overall sentiment is `[Your specific % - e.g., 72% positive]`, specific themes like `{topic_labels_config.get(3, "Problematic Topic A (e.g., Fabric Quality)")}` and `{topic_labels_config.get(1, "Problematic Topic B (e.g., Sizing)")}` consistently show significantly lower sentiment scores (average compound: `[Score e.g., -0.15]`), strongly correlating with lower product ratings.</li>
        <li><strong>Dominant Customer Conversations:</strong> The analysis of over `[Number e.g., 20,000]` reviews pinpointed {num_topics_config} primary discussion themes. `{topic_labels_config.get(2, "Most Prevalent Topic (e.g., Style)")}` and `{topic_labels_config.get(7, "Second Prevalent Topic (e.g., Overall Satisfaction)")}` emerged as the most frequently discussed.</li>
        <li><strong>Crucial Topic Interdependencies:</strong> The co-occurrence network highlighted that `{topic_labels_config.get(1, "Topic A (e.g., Sizing)")}` is frequently discussed alongside `{topic_labels_config.get(5, "Topic B (e.g., Returns)")}`. This suggests dissatisfaction with `[Theme A e.g., product fit]` often directly impacts `[Theme B e.g., value and likelihood to return]`.</li>

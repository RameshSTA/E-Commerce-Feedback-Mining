    Based on a comprehensive analysis of **{illustrative_total_reviews_analyzed} customer reviews**, several key patterns emerged:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Landscape:</strong> While overall sentiment leans positive at approximately <strong>{illustrative_positive_sentiment_percentage:.1f}%</strong>, specific themes such as "<em>{illustrative_problem_topic_1_label}</em>" and "<em>{illustrative_problem_topic_2_label}</em>" consistently exhibit significantly lower sentiment scores (average VADER compound: <strong>{illustrative_problem_topic_compound_score:.2f}</strong>), and are strongly correlated with lower product ratings. This pinpoints areas needing immediate attention.</li>
        <li><strong>Dominant Customer Conversations:</strong> The {num_topics_config} identified themes reveal that "<em>{illustrative_most_prevalent_topic_label}</em>" and "<em>{illustrative_second_prevalent_topic_label}</em>" are the most frequently discussed topics, indicating high customer engagement and importance in these areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Topic Interdependencies:</strong> Network analysis highlighted a significant co-occurrence between "<em>{illustrative_interdependent_topic_A_label}</em>" and "<em>{illustrative_interdependent_topic_B_label}</em>". This suggests that dissatisfaction with product fit often directly translates to concerns about value and an increased likelihood of returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Praise for Specific Attributes:</strong> Reviews associated with "<em>{topic_labels_config.get(2, "Style & Appearance")}</em>" frequently contain highly positive language related to design aesthetics and compliments received, indicating strong product appeal in this dimension.</li>

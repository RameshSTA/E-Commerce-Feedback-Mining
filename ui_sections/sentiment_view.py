        **Sentiment Analysis**, also known as opinion mining, is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to 
        determine the emotional tone conveyed within a piece of text. It aims to classify the expressed opinion
        as **positive, negative, or neutral**.

        **Our Approach: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)**
        * In this project, we employ **VADER**, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool.
        * VADER is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media and online content, making it well-suited for analysing customer reviews.
        * For each review, VADER calculates a **compound score** ranging from -1 (most negative) to +1 (most positive).
        * This compound score is then used to categorize each review into one of three distinct sentiment labels:
            * **Positive:** Compound score >= 0.05
            * **Negative:** Compound score <= -0.05
            * **Neutral:** Compound score between -0.05 and 0.05

        **Why is this important for Business?**
        Understanding aggregate and individual customer sentiment allows businesses to:
        * **Rapidly Gauge Overall Customer Satisfaction:** Get a quick pulse on how customers feel about products or services.
        * **Identify Problematic Areas or Praised Features:** Pinpoint specific aspects that are driving negative or positive experiences.
        * **Uncover Deeper Insights Beyond Star Ratings:** For example, a 3-star review might contain predominantly positive language about certain aspects, or a 5-star review might highlight a minor concern.
        * **Prioritize Improvement Efforts:** Focus resources on addressing issues that generate the most negative sentiment, thereby directly impacting customer experience and fostering loyalty.
        * **Track Sentiment Over Time:** (Future enhancement) Monitor changes in sentiment in response to product updates, marketing campaigns, or service improvements.
